# Multi server-side

This variable template lets you store different Google Tag Manager server-side endpoint URLs at the same time, and dynamically assign them to the Google Analytics events, based on certain conditions.<br>
The available conditions are "contains", "match regex" and "equals". You can use a string-formatted value or variable to be checked against them.<br>
For example, you may want to send data to different active server containers based on the event name, hostname, page, country, language or other website and tracking information.<br>
An additional plus is the possibility to quickly enable or disable a single server-side endpoint of the list, without having to touch other settings in your GTM, Google Cloud or third-party vendor of the server container deployment.
