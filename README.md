The repository itself and all the included files are under the MIT License.

# instructions
- Download the .tpl file you want to import, from the specific template directory.
- Create a new template in GTM (depending on which type you are importing).
- Select "Import" in the action menu (top right corner of the template editor).
- Upload the designated .tpl file.
You should always import to a newly created template, to avoid overwriting your own work in an existing template editor instance.<br><br>
All the templates in this repository are organized by type and then by template name.
